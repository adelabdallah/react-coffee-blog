# React Coffee Blog

Coffee blog 2.0, now in React.

`cd react-coffee-blog; yarn install` for requisite dependencies. `yarn run dev-server` for a dev server at `localhost:8080`.

Not all posts have been written. In fact, only 3 out of 97 have been written. Turns out it takes less time to make a blog than to write like ten thousand words. They'll be completed some day. Hopefully.

This also means you have a 3 in 97 chance for the "Random Post" button to actually give you a completed post, which was a blast to test, lemme tell ya. `Enter` + `Esc` spam helps.
